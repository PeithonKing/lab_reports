# 6th Semester Lab Reports (in LaTeX)

This repository contains the lab reports for the 6th semester of my Integrated MSc at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar, India. We had two lab courses in the 6th semester, namely:

- Nuclear Physics Lab
- Solid State Physics Lab

We had to write Lab Reports for the experiments in these courses. The reports were written in LaTeX. The reports are available in the following directories:
