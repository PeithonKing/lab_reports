	Our study focused on the interaction of Tl-304 and Sr-90 sources with different absorber materials. We estimated the range of beta particles for these sources in aluminium absorbers and calculated the endpoint energy for Sr-90 with a 3.6\% error margin. We also observed backscattering effects with the aluminium absorber and studied the Bremsstrahlung phenomenon for three different absorbers. Our findings revealed that metal absorbers, such as aluminium, absorb more energy in Bremsstrahlung compared to plastic. The results of our study have important implications in fields such as nuclear medicine and radiation therapy, enabling better shielding materials to be developed and improved safety measures to be implemented to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure.
