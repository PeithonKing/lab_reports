\section{Error}

	The calculated error in the endpoint energy of $Sr^{90}$ is 0.036, which is obtained using the formula: $$\frac{\delta E}{E}=\frac{\delta R}{R}=\sqrt{(\frac{\delta t_1}{t_1}^2)+(\frac{\delta t_2}{t_2})^2}$$ The thickness of the aluminum sheet is insignificant in causing the error in the endpoint energy calculation, and other sources of error such as voltage fluctuations, non-uniform sheet thickness, or the presence of other radioactive sources nearby may have contributed to random errors. In summary, the measured endpoint energy of $Sr^{90}$ is lower than the expected value of $2.276;MeV$, and the error in the measurement is relatively small.
