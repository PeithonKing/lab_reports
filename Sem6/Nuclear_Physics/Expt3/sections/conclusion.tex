\section{Conclusion}
	At 600V, we can observe that the detector has a resolution of 10\%. We can also determine the Gamma energy peaks for unknown sources by calibrating MCA channels with known sources. In SCA, the error in fitting the Gaussian curve is modest and may be lowered further with more data points. Aluminium has a high estimated mass absorption coefficient, making it an effective material for blocking gamma radiation.
