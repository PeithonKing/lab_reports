		Table 6
		\input{tables/cstable.tex}
		from \hyperref[tab:cs]{Table 6} we have FWHM = $46.8672$

		Resolution is defined as the ratio of FWHM and peak channel.

	\subsection{Energy calibration of gamma-ray spectrometer with energies of different Gamma Sources}
		Three different sources are placed in front of detector at once and spectrum is analysed to obtain the calibration curve.

	\subsection{Find of energy of Na-22 source}

		\end{figure}
		\input{tables/Natable.tex}
		From 8 and the energy calibration curve, we find that Na-22 has peak energies at 500KeV(ch-223),680 keV(ch-290), 1220KeV(Ch-554).
	\subsection{Mass absorption coefficient of Al}
		For 662 keV gamma rays, the mass absorption coefficient of Al is measured by placing aluminum blocks of different thicknesses between the detector and the source.\\

		From the graph Observed value of HVL (thickness at which counts are reduced to half) is 0.4cm.\\
		Density thickness=\(0.4\times 2.7gm/cm^3 =1.08gm/cm^2\)\\
