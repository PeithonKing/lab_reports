	We investigate gamma-ray spectroscopy of several materials using a Scintillation detector in both SCA and MCA modes. Using Cs-137's known energy spectrum, we determine that the working voltage is 600V with a resolution of 10.11\%. In MCA mode, we calibrated the channels using known peak energy sources, $Ba^{133}$, $Co^{60}$, and $Cs^{137}$, and determined the peak energy for $Na^{22}$ from the calibrated curve. We computed the mass absorption coefficient of Al by sandwiching different thicknesses of aluminium blocks between the detector and the source, which came out to be $0.641gm/cm^3$.
