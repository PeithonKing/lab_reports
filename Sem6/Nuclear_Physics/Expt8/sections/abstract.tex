	In this experiment, brass and aluminum scatterers were used to demonstrate the Compton Scattering effect. In both situations, we found that the relative energy and intensity of scattered photons dropped with increasing scattering angle. We calculated the calibration factor for each example, and the results are $2.71 \times 10^{32}$ for aluminum and $5.05 \times 10^{32}$ for brass. Additionally, we determined the rest mass of electrons, which was $450.99\pm0.11$ KeV on average.
