\section{Conclusion}
	We investigated electron Compton scattering in this experiment. We can see from the data that the intensity and energy of photons drop as the scattering angle rises, which is consistent with the Compton formula. We discover that the detector's calibration factors fluctuate depending on the substance. Brass has a calibration factor around double that of aluminium, implying that relative intensity for specific cross-sections is greater for brass than aluminum. We also computed the rest mass of electrons with substantial error, which may be reduced by using the lead box with prudence. Thus, the following formula may be used to calculate the rest mass of charged particles such as electrons.
