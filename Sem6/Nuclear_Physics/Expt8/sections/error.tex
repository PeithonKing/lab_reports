\section{Error}
	The expected value of $m_e$ is $0.511MeV$, but for each case the observed value is much greater than the expected value.

	$$\Delta m_e = \frac{\abs{m_e(observed) -m_e(theory)}}{m_e(theory)}$$
	thus we have, for aluminum:
	$\Delta m_e = 0.056$
	and for brass,
	$\Delta m_e = 0.1788$

	We made an error of $11.7\%$ in our calculations. This might be because we put the lead block in the wrong place. It could be too close to the scattering body and not let all the scattered photons pass. This is shown by the reduced peaks in the scattering spectra. We can fix this by moving the lead block further away from the scattering body.
