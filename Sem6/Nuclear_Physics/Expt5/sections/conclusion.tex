\section{Conclusion}
	In order to discover the relationship between scattering rate and angle, we researched Rutherford scattering. Additionally, we have determined the aluminium atomic number accurately. The required precautions to be taken are:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item When the vacuum pump is running, the gold leaf needs to be parallel to the nozzle. High velocity air might rupture the thin \& expensive gold foil.
		\item Any amount of air inside the vacuum chamber will cause the readings to be non-uniform and inaccurate.
		\item The offset discriminator has to be set properly to get the correct readings.
		\item The gold foil should not be touched by the hands. The oil from the hands might make a layer on the foil, which will cause the readings to be inaccurate. It can also cause the foil to be damaged.
	\end{itemize}
