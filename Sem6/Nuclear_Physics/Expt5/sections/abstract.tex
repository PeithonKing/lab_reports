	By blasting alpha particles in a vacuum chamber via a thin gold leaf, we have researched Rutherford scattering and determined the relationship for the scattering rate at various angles using a detector. We have also utilised the relationship to determine the charge number of aluminium by utilising an identical-sized piece of aluminium foil. The experiment counts the number of detections at various angles using electrical components like a counter and discriminator.
