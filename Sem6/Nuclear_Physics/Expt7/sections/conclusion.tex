\section{Conclusion}
	In this experiment, we studied the working of Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) using integrated circuits. By considering the different parameters that define the performance of a converter, we calculated the linearity error in the slope of the ADC and DAC plot between theoretical and experimental values. The low error confirms the validity of the experiment.

	\subsection{Sample and Hold Circuit Parameters}
		During the experiment, we also encountered certain terms related to the Sample and Hold circuit. The \textbf{Acquisition Time} ($t_{ac}$) is the time it takes for the charge in the holding capacitor to reach a level close to the input voltage. It depends on the RC time constant, OPAMP's slew rate, and output current. As the capacitance ($C$) increases, the acquisition time also increases.

		The \textbf{Droop Rate} is the rate at which voltage droop develops when the leakage current drops the voltage across the holding capacitor. For higher capacitance, the leakage is smaller since the capacitor has more capacity to store charges, hence the droop rate decreases.

		In conclusion, this experiment provided hands-on experience with ADC and DAC using ICs and helped in understanding the significance of the different parameters of Sample and Hold circuit.
