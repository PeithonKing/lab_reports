	This experiment involved the construction and analysis of digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits using integrated circuits. By sampling an input AC signal and passing it through a series of ADC and DAC, we were able to observe and verify that the output analog voltage is approximately equal to the input signal. We also studied the working and pin diagram of the ICs, and discussed the importance of sampling in these circuits. Overall, the experiment provided valuable insights into the operation and applications of DAC and ADC circuits.
