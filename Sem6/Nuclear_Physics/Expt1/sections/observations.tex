\section{Observations \& Calculations}
	\subsection{GM characteristics}
		A gamma source $(Cs^{137})$ was used and the voltage was varied to get the data in \hyperref[tab:1]{Table 1}. From the data, the curve was plotted as shown in \hyperref[graph:1]{Figure 3}. Data was taken for 60s keeping the $Cs^{137}$ source at a distance of 6cm from the GM counter.

		\end{figure}

		From the graph we can see:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Lower threshol volatge = $390 V$
			\item Upper threshold voltage = $630 V$
			\item Plateu length = $(630 - 390) V = 240 V$
			\item Counts at lower threshold voltage = $(N) = 4910$
			\item Slope = $1.99$
			\item Plateau Slope percent $(s) = \frac{slope}{N}*10000 = \frac{1.99}{4910}*10000 = 4.073\%$
			\item Operating Volatage = $\frac{600+360}{2} = 510 V$
		\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Inverse Square Law}

			\caption{Counts vs distance graph}
			\label{graph:3}
		\end{figure}

		We can clearly see in \hyperref{tab:3}{Table 3} that the value of $Rd^2$ is almost constant. Thus, we can say that the inverse square law is valid for the given data.

			\label{graph:2}
		\end{figure}

		From the graph in \hyperref[graph:2]{Figure 4}, we can see that the data points lie on a straight line. Also the slope of the line is $-2$. Thus, we can say that the inverse square law is valid for the given data.

	\subsection{Efficiency}
		Given data:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $d = 1.5cm$
			\item Activity of $Cs^{137}$ = $86 kBq$ (as of May 2016)
			\item Activity of $Tl^{204}$ = $10 kBq$ (as of May 2016)
			\item $\therefore$ Activity of $Cs^{137} \approx 73447 Bq$ (half life $\approx$ 30 years) (after 6 years 11 months, in March 2023)
			\item $\therefore$ Activity of $Tl^{204} \approx  2847 Bq$ (half life $\approx$ 3.77 years) (after 6 years 11 months, in March 2023)
		\end{itemize}

		Therefore using \hyperref[eq:2]{Equation 2} we get:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $DPS_{Cs} = \frac{73447 \times (1.5)^2}{1600} = 351.56$
			\item $DPS_{Tl} = \frac{2847 \times (1.5)^2}{1600} = 120.94$
		\end{itemize}

		From \hyperref[tab:4]{Table 4}, we can see that:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $CPS_{Cs} = 11.178$
			\item $CPS_{Tl} =  37.067$
		\end{itemize}

		Thus calculating the efficiency using \hyperref[eq:1]{Equation 1}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Eff$_{Cs} = \frac{CPS_{Cs}}{DPS_{Cs}}*100 = \frac{11.178}{351.56}*100 = 31.62\%$
			\item Eff$_{Tl} = \frac{CPS_{Tl}}{DPS_{Tl}}*100 = \frac{37.067}{120.94}*100 = 30.65\%$
		\end{itemize}

		We can see that for both the sources, the efficiency is almost the same. Thus, we can say that the efficiency is independent of the source and is a property of the detector.

	\subsection{Counting Statistics}

		For the counting statistics, we took 100 counts with the $Cs^{137}$ source. By plotting the counts vs their frequencies of occurence, we plotted \hyperref[graph:4]{Figure 6}. Although here the data (which is only 100 numbers) is not tabulated, you can easily see the whole data if you get this excel sheet: \href{https://github.com/PeithonKing/lab\_reports/raw/main/Sem6/Nuclear\_Physics/Expt1/gm1.xlsx}{https://github.com/PeithonKing/lab\_reports/raw/main/
		Sem6/Nuclear\_Physics/Expt1/gm1.xlsx}.
		
		From the graph, we see that the data is mostly concentrated around the mean value. Thus, we can say that the data is normally distributed.
