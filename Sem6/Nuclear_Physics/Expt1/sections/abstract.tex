	The experiment aimed to explore the basics of GM Counter-Characteristics and Counting Statistics in nuclear physics. The Geiger-Muller (GM) counter was used to study radioactivity, determine its characteristics, confirm the inverse square law related to gamma rays, calculate source efficiency, and analyze counting statistics. The results showed that the GM characteristic curve closely resembled an ideal one and confirmed the inverse square law. It was also found that the GM counter was more efficient in detecting radiation from $Tl^{204}$ ($\beta$-rays). However, the counting statistics distributions were incomplete due to insufficient sample numbers or defects.
