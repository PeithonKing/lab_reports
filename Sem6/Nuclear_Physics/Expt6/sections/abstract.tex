\begin{abstract}
	In the experiment, we studied the working
of an ADC and DAC amplifier and constructed them
using ICs and resistors. We found that the AC output shows a small deviation from the expected values for the DAC circuit. In the second part, using a comparator, we converted analog output to 2-bit digital output. In the third part, we extended the circuit to obtain decimal output from the digital output, using IC 7447 (binary to BCD decoder) and BCD display.
