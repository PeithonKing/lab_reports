 \subsection{Precautions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item To avoid loose connections and short circuits, the connections should be correctly constructed.
            \item Resistors and integrated circuits must be tested for characteristics and functionality before being used in a circuit.
            \item To avoid fusing, connect the LEDs to the resistor.
            \item To avoid burning an op-amp, the biassing voltage should not exceed the specified value.
        \end{itemize}
