\section{Conclusion}
	As a result, in the experiment, we investigated the operation of an ADC and DAC amplifier and built them with simple electronic components. We discovered the linearity error in the slope of the DAC plot between the theoretical and experimental values using our understanding of the numerous parameters governing the performance of a converter and discovered that it agreed more for smaller number of bits at the digital input. We noticed that while the DAC converter is operational, it displays a tiny deviation from the required voltage, which may be ignored. However, with larger bit converters, the variation may increase. We also learnt how to convert digital output to decimal using a BCD display.
