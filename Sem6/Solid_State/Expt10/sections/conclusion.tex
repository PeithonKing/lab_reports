\section{Conclusion}
	In conclusion, the experiment allowed us to understand the theory behind the calculation of the gravitational acceleration (g) using a complex pendulum. By using SeeLab, we were able to automate the data collection process, making it easy and efficient to obtain accurate measurements.

	We learned that SeeLab is a powerful device that enables hardware-software integration and allows for coding in Python. It has multiple input and output pins that can be utilized for various types of experiments.

	The second part of the experiment, conducted in the lift, allowed us to measure the acceleration of the lift, highlighting the potential applications of this technique in other areas.

	Overall, the experiment demonstrated the utility of SeeLab and the benefits of combining hardware and software to obtain accurate measurements. It provided a valuable learning experience and insight into the world of experimental physics.
