	This report presents the results of a series of electronics experiments conducted using SeeLab, a hardware-software integration tool. The experiments included analyzing the output characteristics of an NPN transistor, studying the performance of different 555 multi-vibrator circuits, validating Faraday's and Lenz's laws, and observing the emf dependence on the velocity of a falling magnet. The experiments were designed to explore various concepts in electronics and demonstrate the capabilities of SeeLab as a flexible and versatile tool for hands-on learning and experimentation. The results obtained provide insights into the behavior of electronic circuits and validate fundamental electromagnetic principles.
