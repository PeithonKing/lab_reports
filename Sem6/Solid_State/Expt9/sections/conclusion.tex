\section{Conclusion}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The NPN characteristics graph showed expected results, with the collector current remaining constant for a given base current, independent of the collector voltage above the threshold voltage of the Base-collector region.
		\item The Multi-vibrator555 graph also matched the expected behavior in both cases, although there were slight errors in observed frequency and duty cycle values due to resistance and capacitance tolerances.
		\item The EM wave graph exhibited two opposite peaks at different times, with the second peak being larger than the first peak. This indicates that the induced emf depends on the velocity of the magnet, with a higher moment of the magnet resulting in a larger emf. Negligible effects from Lenz's law and buoyant force were observed, and the magnetic moment of the magnet was calculated to be $0.2161 Am^2$.
