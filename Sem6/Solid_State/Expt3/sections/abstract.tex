	In this experiment, we investigate the Hall effect of semiconductors, specifically the value of the Hall coefficient for both n- and p-type germanium samples at room temperature. The observed values are found to be $2.01\pm 0.017 \mathrm{cm^3\ coulomb^{-1}}$ and $3.02 \pm 0.041 \mathrm{cm^3\ coulomb^{-1}}$ for p-type and n-type germanium, respectively. In the second part of the experiment, we examine the dependence of the Hall coefficient on temperature for p-type germanium, and observe an inversion in the Hall coefficient at high temperatures. Furthermore, we find that the Hall coefficient exhibits a nonlinear decrease with increasing temperature. These results have important implications for the understanding and characterization of semiconductors and their electronic properties.
