	We used UV-Vis spectroscopy to determine the direct band gap energies of CdS $(2.31 eV)$ and ZnTe $(2.03 eV)$ with errors of $4.5\%$ and $10.17\%$ respectively, and the indirect band gap of a polymer $(0.86 eV)$. Plotting $\alpha^2$ and $\alpha^{\sfrac{1}{2}}$ vs. band gap energies revealed higher absorption range and lower band gap energy for the polymer, suggesting its potential for solar cells. Our findings provide insights into the band gap nature of these materials and highlight the suitability of the polymer for optoelectronic applications.
