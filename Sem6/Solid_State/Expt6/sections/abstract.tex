	For $BaTiO_3$, we investigated the phase transition from the ferroelectric to the paraelectric state and the frequency and temperature dependence of the dielectric constant in the aforementioned experiment. We also noticed the frequency dependence of capacitance for multilayer and disc ceramic capacitors operating at room temperature. We determine the balancing capacitance to arrive at the balancing resistance of the sample at various temperature settings using the Schering bridge, and we plot the result to confirm with the theoretical overview. We discover that the $BaTiO_3$ sample's curie temperature is $140^\circ C$, which is higher than the value predicted by theory and indicating the presence of impurities in the sample. Additionally, the computed diffuseness parameter ranges from 1 to 2 for all frequencies.
