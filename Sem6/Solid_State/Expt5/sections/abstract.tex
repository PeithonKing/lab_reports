	Using an LC low pass filter, we investigated the lattice vibration of a monoatomic and diatomic crystal in the provided experiment. We discover that a lattice spring and mass model is akin to an LC circuit, and the equation for the resonant frequency yields a similar dispersion relation, so demonstrating the analogy. We have now discovered the maximum resonant frequency of vibration in a monoatomic lattice similar circuit and the frequency band gap in a diatomic lattice analogous circuit.
