\section{Results \& Discussions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item From $C$ vs. $V_{DC}$ graph, we can see that capacitance as Dc voltage increases, the capacitance decreases due to an increase in depletion region as expected from theory.
    \item we see that $\frac{1}{C^2}$ vs $V_{DC}$ show linear relationship fro high voltage only.
    \item from Table 1-4, we can see that the overall capacitance  of solar cells decreases as the intensity of light increases due to an increase in depletion region width.
    \item From table 5, we can see that the doping density decreases as light intensity increases implying more charge carriers are produced as expected in the case of solar cells. Also, the built-in voltage decreases with increased light intensity due to the accumulation of more charge carriers in the depletion region.
    \item the error calculated is small and can be due to the continuous fluctuation of multimeter value sometimes, which can be due to loose connection or non-uniform light intensity in light conditions, or fluctuating frequency of AC signal in function generator. Errors are small and mostly random we can say that the experimental procedure is efficient to measure the capacitance of solar cells.
