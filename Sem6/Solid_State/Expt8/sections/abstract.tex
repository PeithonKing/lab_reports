	In this experiment, we investigated the C-V characteristics of a solar cell under various conditions. Our results showed that the capacitance of the solar cell is inversely proportional to the intensity of light, indicating a strong dependence on light intensity. Furthermore, by analyzing the data obtained under total dark conditions, we determined the doping density of the solar cell to be $(4.4\pm0.021) \times10^{17} m^{-3}$, with a built-in voltage of $0.76\pm0.0427 V$. Our analysis also revealed that both doping density and built-in voltage decrease as light intensity increases. Finally, we observed that the capacitance of the solar cell decreases as the applied reverse DC voltage increases, indicating the presence of a strong electric field within the cell.
