	The Four-Probe method, utilizing four collinear probes for electrical contact, was employed to measure the resistivity of Silicon, Germanium, and Aluminium foil at room temperature. Additionally, the band gap energy of Germanium was determined by analyzing the temperature dependence of resistivity. The results exhibit close agreement upon closer inspection.
