	Using various filters, we investigated the operation of a solar cell and its I-V characteristics in the experiment. As a result of the relationship between the current and voltage across the cell, we were able to determine several characteristics such as open circuit voltage, short circuit current, and maximum power. We observed that the values of these parameters changed for the various filters employed as they blocked different wavelengths of light, affecting the intensity and energy of the falling photons. As a result, the I-V characteristics of various filters differ.
