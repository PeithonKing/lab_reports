\section{Conclusion}
Hence we have studied the I-V characteristics of solar cell and how it behaves under different filters. The results are mostly in accordance with the theory.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The imperfections in the filters, more being transmitting than the others.
	\item Noises in the multimeter reading. It happened especially for the lamp case and lower resistance case for sunlight case. The reading should be allowed to be settled or average value should be noted. The reading was left as the discernment of the experimeters.
	\item Incorrect placement of the solar cell either in shadow or not correctly covered with filter. There should be no opening left when covering the cell.
	\item Cloudy conditions for yellow, pink and red filters in sunlight case. We could find the impact of cloudy conditions on the reading by using a correction factor from the lamp case and finding the deviation of the power output from the ideal case and cloudy case.
