\section{Observations}
	We carried out the experiment under two different conditions: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Indoors in presence of incandescent lamp
		\item In presence of sunlight
	\end{enumerate}
	All the curves have been fitted with equation:
	
	\begin{equation}
		I(V) = Ae^{BV} - C.
		\label{eq:2}
	\end{equation}
	
	Here, $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the parameters. The I-V Characteristics of the solar cell under those conditions are as follows:

		The data collected for the I-V characteristics of the solar cell under incandescent lamp is given in \hyperref[tab:indoor]{Table 1}. The I-V curve for no filter has been shown in \hyperref[graph:1]{Figure 5} and the I-V curve for different filters has been shown in \hyperref[graph:2]{Figure 6}.

	\subsection{Outdoors in presence of Sunlight}

		The data collected for the I-V characteristics of the solar cell under incandescent lamp is given in \hyperref[tab:outdoor]{Table 2}. The I-V curve for no filter has been shown in \hyperref[graph:3]{Figure 7} and the I-V curve for different filters has been shown in \hyperref[graph:4]{Figure 8}.
