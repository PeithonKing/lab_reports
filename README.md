# 5th Semester Lab Reports (in LaTeX)

This repository contains the lab reports for the 5th semester of my Integrated MSc at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar, India. We had three lab courses in the 5th semester, namely:

- Optics Lab
- Modern Physics Lab
- Computational Physics Lab

We had to write Lab Reports for the 1st two and coding assignments for the last. The reports for the first two are written in LaTeX and the codes for the last are writen in Python. Here are all of them:

## Optics Lab

1. [**Experiment 2:** Splitting of sodium D-lines using diffraction grating](./Optics_Lab/Expt_2/main.pdf)
2. [**Experiment 3:** Diffraction of light due to ultrasonic wave propagation in liquids](./Optics_Lab/Expt_3/main.pdf)
3. [**Experiment 4:** Study of Polarization of Light](./Optics_Lab/Expt_4/main.pdf)
4. [**Experiment 5:** Michelson's Interferometer](./Optics_Lab/Expt_5/main.pdf)
5. [**Experiment 6:** Fabry Pérot Interferometer](./Optics_Lab/Expt_6/main.pdf)
6. [**Experiment 1:** Diffraction of light](./Optics_Lab/Expt_1/main.pdf)

## Modern Physics Lab

1. [**Experiment 2:** Zeemann Effect](./Modern_Physics/Expt_2/main.pdf)
2. [**Experiment 3:** Emission spectra of Hydrogen and determination of Rydberg constant](./Modern_Physics/Expt_3/main.pdf)
3. [**Experiment 4:** Emission spectra of metals and Absorption spectrum of Iodine vapour using constant deviation spectrometer](./Modern_Physics/Expt_4/main.pdf)
4. [**Experiment 7:** Study of Electron Spin Resonance](./Modern_Physics/Expt_7/main.pdf)
5. [**Experiment 6:** Study of Franck Hertz experiment](./Modern_Physics/Expt_6/main.pdf)
6. [**Esperiment 5:** Study of Lock in amplifier](./Modern_Physics/Expt_5/main.pdf)
7. 

**Note:** I have a separate GitHub repository to keep the codes from the Computational Physics Lab: [PeithonKing/comp_phys_P346](https://github.com/PeithonKing/comp_phys_P346).
